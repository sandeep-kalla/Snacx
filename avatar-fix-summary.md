# Group Member Avatar Fix

## Issue:
Group member avatars not displaying in the chat member list - only showing default ðŸ‘¤ icons instead of user avatars.

## Root Cause:
The code was calling `getAvatarById(memberProfile.avatar).emoji` but the `getAvatarById` function returns an object with a `url` property, not an `emoji` property.

## Fix Applied:

### Location: `app/components/ChatWindow.tsx` line 432

**Before:**
```javascript
{memberProfile?.avatar ? getAvatarById(memberProfile.avatar).emoji : 'ðŸ‘¤'}
```

**After:**
```javascript
{memberProfile?.avatar ? getAvatarById(memberProfile.avatar)?.url || 'ðŸ‘¤' : 'ðŸ‘¤'}
```

### Additional Debugging Added:
Added console logging to track profile loading:
- Logs when member profiles are being loaded
- Logs each individual profile as it's loaded
- Logs the final profiles object
- Logs when no profile is found for a user

## How It Works:

1. **Profile Loading**: When a group chat is opened, the `useEffect` hook triggers `loadMemberProfiles()`
2. **Profile Fetching**: For each participant ID, it calls `UserService.getUserProfile(memberId)`
3. **Avatar Display**: Uses `getAvatarById(avatar).url` to get the emoji/avatar from the avatar ID
4. **Fallback**: Shows 'ðŸ‘¤' if no avatar is found

## Expected Results:

âœ… **Group member avatars should now display correctly**
âœ… **Console logs will show profile loading progress**
âœ… **Fallback to ðŸ‘¤ if avatar fails to load**

## Testing Steps:

1. Open a group chat
2. Check the group members section
3. Verify avatars are displayed for each member
4. Check browser console for profile loading logs
5. Verify "You" shows your own avatar

## Debugging Information:

If avatars still don't show, check the console for:
- "Loading member profiles for participants: [array]"
- "Loaded profile for [userId]: [profile object]"
- "No profile found for [userId]"
- "All member profiles loaded: [profiles object]"

This will help identify if the issue is:
- Profile loading failure
- Avatar ID missing in profiles
- Avatar ID not found in avatar database
- UI rendering issue
